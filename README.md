# Deep-Learning-in-Bioinformatics-Papers-Reading-Roadmap
>If you are a newcomer to apply the the Deep Learning in bioinformatics area, the first question you may have is "What is the profile of deep learning in bioinformatics at present?"

>Here is a reading roadmap of papers applying Deep Learning in bioinformatics!

>This project is a imitation of Deep-Learning-Papers-Reading-Roadmap (https://github.com/songrotek/Deep-Learning-Papers-Reading-Roadmap)

The roadmap is constructed in accordance with the following four guidelines:

- From outline to detail
- From old to state-of-the-art
- from generic to specific areas
- focus on state-of-the-art
You will find many papers that are quite new but really worth reading.

I would continue adding papers to this roadmap.
