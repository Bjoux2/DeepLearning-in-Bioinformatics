# Deep-Learning-in-Bioinformatics-Papers-Reading-Roadmap
>If you are a newcomer to apply the the Deep Learning in bioinformatics area, the first question you may have is "What is the profile of deep learning in bioinformatics at present?"

>Here is a reading roadmap of papers applying Deep Learning in bioinformatics!

Those papers are mainly published in _Nature_, _Nature Methods_, _Nature protocols_, _NAR_, _Briefings in Bioinformatics_, _Bioinformatics_, _Drug Discovery Today_, _Genome Research_, _Genome Biology_, _PLoS computational biology_, _JCIM_, _JPR_, _Distill Pub_, _CACM_, _JACM_, _JMLR_, and _NIPS_.

The recently added journals are _AC_ _Nature Chemistry_, _Nature Reviews Chemistry_, and _Nature structural & molecular biology_.

I would continue adding papers to this roadmap.
